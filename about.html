Sauti’s trade and market information platform directly targets the barriers to information to enhance small-scale competitiveness and profitability in East Africa</p>

                <li><p>Baseline data indicates that prior to using Sauti traders were spending 3.50-13USD on calls to other traders/brokers to access trade and market information and 50min-5hours travelling to markets in order to access market information. By using Sauti, cross-border traders are spending as much as $0.50USD per week in network access fees to access trade and market information and no longer need to travel to markets to verify market information.</p></li><br>
                <li><p>76% of surveyed users said that since using Sauti they are aware of the requirements for clearing their goods through the gazetted border, while 57% are aware of the taxes applicable to their consignments.</p></li>
